## Nice to see you here ðŸ‘‹


I'm passionate about software development, especially full-stack web development. I aim to put my theoretical knowledge (OOP, design patterns, SOLID principles) into practice by producing high quality code. Learning new methodologies for writing scalable and maintainable software products is exciting for me.

My short term goal is to spend my last year in university working part-time or remotely. In long term, I want to become an expert with in-depth knowledge of the best practices for building web services and apps.


#### Right now I'm working on:

- âœ¨ Improving my previous web projects with *TypeScript* and *Sass*
- ðŸ’š Configuring my VPS, so that I can host web applications written in any programming language (thanks to *Nginx*)
- ðŸ“š Learning about *web3*
