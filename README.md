Right now, my primary goal is to get the chance for an internship at [Appcent](https://www.appcent.mobi).

I heard that they are using Spring Boot for backend, so expect more Java and Spring Boot projects here soon.

This internship would be a great opportunity for me. I *really* want to work for Appcent.

Wish me luck 😁
